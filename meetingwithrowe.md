### issues that attendance has:
- addressed thru email, docs, etc
- biggest issue with people doing things wrong/not following policies

### could make changes to warning system
- need an electronic signature

### ideas
- add more to DN school website under attendance tab
- make attendance website easier to read/less word heavy
- know what mistakes have happened so we can cater towards preventing them
- make a prototype website to try and get the official website changed
- could automate contact tracing

#### contact tracing
- pull from synergy to a doc
- if reason for abscence is covid then pull info to docs
- need to know the date they were last at school and who else in their class was at school that day (if loop nested in a for loop)
- how do they know what students to contact? automate this too (teacher could select names of people close to person with covid and then that sends info to parents)
- student calls out for covid, pull info on teachers, contact teachers, pull info on students, get parent email, contact parents
