### would like to automate contact tracing:
- pull from synergy to a doc
- if reason for abscence is covid then pull info to docs
- automate contact to teachers, 
- how do they know what students to contact? automate this too (teacher could select names of people close to person with covid and then that sends info to parents)
- student calls out for covid, pull info on teachers, contact teachers, pull info on students, get parent email, contact parents




# most likely not doing what is below
Sponsor: Mr. Mortensen, jmortensen@powayusd.com

- Combination of a canvas calendar and scrum board
- Login feature to allow for collaboration within groups and for each person to have a role (TO, OO, scrum master, etc)
- Checklist to track complete tasks, better than canvas because you can check off individual tasks and steps needed to complete those tasks, ie: 
"Create Performance Task PBL feature
Final committed program code showing algorithms written in JS/Python
Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task
1min video that meets CB create task requirements
Team Final Grading Considerations - 5 pts"

Or: 

"PBL Github pages. Jekyll, WIKI, live review focus PBL theme consistent through project and described in Github Pages, Sassy / Bootstrap, Blueprint illustration/demonstration, CRUD Async Operation - runtime and understanding of JavaScript and Fetch, Individual PBL MVC feature/commits showing algorithms written in JS/Python"

- Our website consolidates this and makes them into a to do list with subtasks that can be assigned to individuals
- Each part of the canvas assignment  can be it's own task that can be checked off when completed and delegated to other people
- "Final committed program code showing algorithms written in JS/Python" --> 
a checklist with
- [ ] idea of create task (complete/incomplete)
- [ ] how to code? use if loops for __, iterate through __ to __
- [ ] HTML (complete/incomplete)
- [ ] Python (complete/incomplete)

- Don't need to copy/paste from canvas into scrumboard and will be a more streamlined way to view tasks in a scumboard

- Additionally, we will make a more streamlined weekly to do list than what was used during first and second tri
