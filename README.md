***

- Combination of a canvas calendar and scrum board
- Login feature to allow for collaboration within groups and for each person to have a role (TO, OO, scrum master, etc)
- Checkboxes for complete tasks, better than canvas because you can check off individual tasks and  include steps to complete those tasks, ie: 
Canvas says: 
"Create Performance Task PBL feature
Final committed program code showing algorithms written in JS/Python
Written responses to all the prompts in the performance task
1min video that meets CB create task requirements
Team Final Grading Considerations - 5 pts

PBL Github pages. Jekyll, WIKI, live review focus
PBL theme consistent through project and described in Github Pages
Sassy / Bootstrap
Blueprint illustration/demonstration
CRUD Async Operation - runtime and understanding of JavaScript and Fetch
Individual PBL MVC feature/commits showing algorithms written in JS/Python"

- Our website consolidates this and makes them into a to do list with subtasks that can be assigned to individuals
- Each part of the canvas assignment  can be it's own task that can be checked off when completed and delegated to other people
- "Final committed program code showing algorithms written in JS/Python" --> 
a checklist with
"1. idea of create task (complete/incomplete)
2. how to code? use if loops for __, iterate through __ to __
3. HTML (complete/incomplete)
4. Python (complete/incomplete)
5. etc"

- Don't need to copy/paste from canvas into scrumboard and will be a more streamlined way to view tasks in a scumboard

- Additionally, we will make a more streamlined weekly to do list than what was used during first and second tri
