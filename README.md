- If reason for abscence is COVID then pull info to docs
- Automate email to teachers, give them form (with dropdown menu?) to select students who were in close contact
- After form submission program pulls parents' emails from student info, notify parents

# Contributing/committing
### **PULL BEFORE YOU PUSH** (to avoid any oopie doopies)
Don't commit a file that you didn't do anything to (just don't).

`.repil` and any IDE config files should **NOT** be pushed

### Committing sequence
$ `git add file` (replace `file` with whatever file you want to commit) 

$ `git pull` (or your IDE's equivalent)

$ `git push` (or your IDE's equivalent)

$ `git commit` (or your IDE's equivalent)
